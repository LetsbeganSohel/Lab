//2â€¦ In this example, you have a base class Teacher and a sub class ITTeacher. Since 
//class ITTeacher extends the designation and college properties and work () method from 
//base class, we need not to declare these properties and method in sub class.
//Here we have college Name, designation and work () method which are common to all the 
//teachers so we have declared them in the base class, this way the child classes like Math 
//Teacher, Music Teacher and PhysicsTeacher do not need to write this code and can be used 
//directly from base class.
